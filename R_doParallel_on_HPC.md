# Solve R error using parallel computing on HPC

## Error message:
`Error in unserialize(node$con) : error reading from connection`


Here are some possible reasons for this error message from Jianjun Hua(Jianjun.Hua@dartmouth.edu) from the research computing:

The error message `Error in unserialize(node$con) : error reading from connection` that you received when running your R script on a computing cluster using the `foreach` function and the `doParallel` package indicates there was a problem with the communication between the master process and the worker nodes. This is a common issue when running parallel processing in R, especially on high-performance computing (HPC) clusters with a setup that might differ from your local machine.

## Cluster Environment
- Resource Limits: The HPC cluster might have limits on the number of cores or amount of memory that your job is allowed to use. If your job exceeds these limits, the cluster's job management system might terminate some of the worker processes, leading to this error.
- Network File System: If your worker processes are reading from or writing to a network file system (NFS), there might be file locking or latency issues that cause problems with `unserialize`.
- Node Communication: The error could be due to worker nodes being unable to communicate effectively with the master node, possibly due to network restrictions or configuration issues on the cluster.

## R Package Issues
- Package Versions: Ensure that the versions of R and all relevant packages (`foreach`, `doParallel`, etc.) are the same on the cluster as on your local machine.
 - Parallel Backend: Confirm that the parallel backend is correctly registered and that the number of cores specified does not exceed the allocation by your cluster's job scheduler.

## Debugging Steps
- Check Resource Allocation: Review the Slurm job script to ensure that the resource requests (like `--cpus-per-task` or `--ntasks`) align with the parallel settings in your R script.
 - Error Handling: Modify your `foreach` loop to include better error handling. You can use `.errorhandling = "pass"` in your `foreach` call to get more insight into which iterations might be causing problems.
- Logging: Add verbose logging to your R script to track progress and potentially catch when and where the error occurs.
 - Test with Reduced Load: Try running the script on the cluster with a reduced number of cores to see if the error persists. This can help determine if the issue is related to the specific cluster configuration or resource limits.

Given the aforementioned, the potential solutions are as follows:
- Explicitly Specify Hosts: If you have control over this, specify the hosts for the worker nodes in your parallel cluster setup.
- Use `doMC` Instead of `doParallel`: On some Unix-like systems, `doMC` can be a good alternative for forking processes without dealing with socket connections.
 - Resource Management: Make sure your Slurm job script correctly requests the necessary resources and doesn't exceed any limits imposed by the cluster.
 - Session Info: After the error occurs, if possible, check `sessionInfo()` to ensure all packages and their dependencies are loaded correctly.

Here is an example of a modified `foreach` loop with improved error handling for debugging purposes:

```
library(foreach)
library(doParallel)

# Register doParallel with the correct number of cores \
cl <- makeCluster(detectCores() - 1) # Always leave one core free
registerDoParallel(cl)

# Your foreach loop with error handling \
results <- foreach(i = 1:n, .packages = c("needed_package"), .errorhandling = "pass") %dopar% {
  tryCatch({
    # Your code here
  }, error = function(e) {
    # Return the error for debugging
    list(error = conditionMessage(e), index = i)
  })
}

# Stop the cluster after processing
stopCluster(cl)
```


This script will attempt to return more informative errors and might help you pinpoint the issue. Remember to adjust `detectCores()` according to your Slurm resource allocation.
