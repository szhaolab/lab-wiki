Jobs submitted with srun –pty /bin/bash will be assigned the cluster default values of 1 CPU and 1024MB of memory. The account must also be specified; the job will not run otherwise. If additional resources are required, they can be requested as options to the srun command. The following example job is assigned 2 nodes with 2 CPUS and 4GB of memory each:
```
srun --nodes=2 --ntasks-per-node=4 --mem-per-cpu=1GB --cpus-per-task=1 --pty /bin/bash
```
## SLURM
If running on the cluster, please edit the cluster.json config file to match your cluster configuration. Once complete, submit the given sbatch file to the cluster.
